## Getting started with react-redux

Redux is a nightmare to many. I too had problem understanding redux when I started learning it, cause there was a lot of boilerplate code, did not understood the store properly and everything seemed too complex. But I kept at it until I got the hang of it. I will try to describe it in simple terms here, so that anyone can understand the basic of redux.

I have created a demo project at [CodeSanxbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/redux-toolkit-q0qcyp?file=/src/index.js). It's a [todo](https://codesandbox.io/s/redux-toolkit-q0qcyp?file=/src/index.js) app that uses redux to control its state. You can follow along the project.
